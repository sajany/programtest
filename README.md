## Description

This repo serves as a reference for the [YouTube playlist found here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0dOL8Z7pG3L4hi2SLJqojxshXNtsJQ_r).

This video will cover end-to-end how to:

* containerize a lambda function locally
* push the image to AWS manually
* push the image to AWS with CI/CD using GitHub Actions
* scheduling the lambda function to run as a recurring cron job
* building custom AWS EventBridge to automate creation of lambda function
* an update to the CI/CD GitHub Action that caches the Docker image on AWS ECR, speeding up run time
